# C Programming: Getting Started


# Unit 1.0

This is the first course of the C Programming with Linux Professional Certificate offered by Dartmouth and IMT.


### Defining Key Terms

Computer - is an object that is made up of hardware components: 
	A processor to do the math, 
	a hard disk to store information, 
	memory, also called RAM, to run applications, and 
	peripherals: 
		keyboard, 
		mouse, 
		screen, 
		printer, and so forth. 

Software - instruct the hardware components what to do.
	It is basically computer code that runs on the computer
	and includes the operating system as well as the applications installed
	on the computer.
	
Algorithm - a sequence of instructions pretty much like a cooking recipe. It
	provides a set of steps to follow in order to achieve a desired result.

We start with input data to the program, process it with the algorithm, and end upwith output data. We often simply speak of program input and program output.
